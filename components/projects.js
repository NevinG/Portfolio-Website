        I worked on this project as a part of The Artifical Intelligence Society (AIS) at UTD.
        I was the mentor for this project, so I was responsible on mentoring three students through
        their very first AI/ML project.

        <br>
        The goal of this project was to explore if you can make art through an evolutionary model.
        To compare the results of our evolutionary model to a baseline we also made a DCGAN model.
        Our evolutionary model results:
        <br>
        <br>
        The goal of this project was to guide my mentee's through their first AI/ML project
        and to see if an evolutionary model for art generation was a viable method. After seeing the results
        our evolutionary model isn't a competitive alternative to the existing technologies like a DCGAN model.

        I worked on this project as a part of The Artifical Intelligence Society (AIS) at UTD.
        I was a mentee being led by a mentor on my first AI/ML project. Our final Model used two seperate models.
        One was a NLP LSTM model trained on the bill text, and the other was a feed forward neural network trained on
        information about the bill like: sponser, author, author party, senate majority, (etc.). 
        <br>
        <br>
        I led three other mentees through the whole data scraping process and model creation for the feed forward neural network.
